  data,
  lambda,
  type = c("general", "expFixed", "twoPara"),
  expFix = 1,
  group = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{n} by \code{(p+2)} data frame in which the first column is subject ID, the second column is
the time point for longitudinal data or tissue ID.}

\item{lambda}{a vector of length 1 or 2,  which
is the tuning parameter for the identification of the networks. For details, see the explanations in the below.}

\item{type}{a string specifying which model need to be fitted. There are three models available,
which are refered as \code{general, expFixed} and \code{twoPara} respectively.
 Please see the details in the below for the meaning of each.}

\item{expFix}{a nemeric number used in the model specification}

\item{group}{a vector  of length \code{n} if supplied which specify which data
points need to be grouped together to infer a network for each of them.}

\item{maxit}{the maximum iterations for the estimation.}

\item{tol}{the minimum value for  convergence criterion}

\item{lower}{a vector of length 1 or 2 which specifies the lower bounds for the optimization algorithm}

\item{upper}{a vector of length 1 or 2 which specifies the upper bounds for the optimization algorithm}

\item{...}{other inputs}
}
\description{
This is the main function of the package, which identifies the underlying  network model from clustered data. Here
 clustered data include longitudinal data, or spatially correlated data,
 e.g, metabolites in different tissues of a same subject.  .
 or more broadly, clustered data for given tuning parameters.
