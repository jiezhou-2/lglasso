\arguments{
\item{type}{what type of dat should be generated. There are three types of data that can be simulated through the function, which are
\code{general}, \code{longihomo} and \code{longiheter} respecitvely.}

\item{n}{number of subjects}

\item{p}{number of nodes}

\item{m1}{number of edges}

\item{m2}{number of edges between general and individual network}

\item{m3}{number of correlated data within one subject}

\item{cc}{correlation matrix between tissues}

\item{tau}{parameters in correlation matrix}

\item{alpha}{parameter in correlation matrix}

\description{
This function generates three types of data based on the given network type. These data can then be used to test the
efficiency of algorithms.
