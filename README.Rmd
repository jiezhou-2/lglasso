<div style="text-align: left"> 

The initial version of the package implemented the algorithms proposed in Zhou et al. (2021),  which can estimate the high-dimensional networks  from longitudinal data using Gassian grapical models. The current 1.0.0 version includes some interesting extensions, e.g., be able to handle data from different tissues within one subject, a more flexible modeling of the longitudinal data, use more stable optimization algorithms etc. The overarching goal however is the same, i.e., explore the possible correlations between high-dimensional data to  improve the estimations of networks. Specifically, the package implements three network models which correspond to three different way how the correlated data are modeled. Furthermore, the package can also estimate the individual networks for each cohorts which is particular useful in clinical studies. There are two main functions in this package. The first one is $lglasso$ which output sparse networks representing the general precision matrix or individual networks, depending on how the input arguments are set up.   The second function, $cv.lglasso$, try to search for the optimal tuning parameters for $lglasso$ using cross validation method.
